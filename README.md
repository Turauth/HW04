This program opens a raylib window, draws rectangles to the window using two points that the cursor clicks and releases as the top left and bottom right corners. Each rectangle is drawn using a different color than the previous one, cycling through a list of five colors: blue, green, yellow, red, and brown. Pressing and releasing the delete key while the cursor is hovering over parts of one or more rectangles deletes them.
